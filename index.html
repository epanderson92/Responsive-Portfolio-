			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/IMG_1003.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="picture of evan">

			<p>My name is Evan Anderson and I am musician.  My primary instrument is guitar, which I have been playing for 10 years. I recently moved back to Austin, Texas from Northern California where I was able to intern in a studio called Sound Garage.  I also was able to play bass in a jazz/blues band who got to open for Pat Travers.</p>
			<p>In addition to playing music I like to study Spanish and Swedish, stand up paddle board, eat pizza and physical activity. I also like to travel. The only place I've been outside of the counrty is Romania, which was a cool experience.  Some tours I've been on have brough me to South Carolina, North Carolina  and Florida.  </p>
